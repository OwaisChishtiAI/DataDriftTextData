Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')","(['As cancer researchers shutter their labs to comply with COVID-19-related work restrictions, some are turning their attention, resources, and technical know-how to the challenge of tackling the deadly coronavirus.'], 'Cancer Labs Pivot to Battle COVID-19.')","(['For decades, it has been largely unknown to what extent multiple functional networks spatially overlap/interact with each other and jointly realize the total cortical function.

The surface of GCE was functionalized with graphene by incubating it with graphene dispersed in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which acted both as a dispersion agent for graphene and as an amine surface modification agent for GCE and graphene. This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking. The developed biosensor used a redox potential of -0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for detecting glucose in the diabetic pathophysiological range 0.5-32 mM. There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood glucose in commercial artificial blood glucose linearity standards in the range 1.4-27.9 mM.

The parietal cortex has long been linked to the processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis.

This translates in the necessity to develop soft and deformable electronics that match the body's mechanics and dynamics. In recent years, various strategies have been proposed to form stretchable circuits and more specifically elastic electrical conductors embedded in elastomeric substrate using either geometrical structuring of solid conductors or intrinsically stretchable materials. Gallium (Ga)-based liquid metals (LMs) are an emerging class of materials offering a particularly interesting set of properties for the design of intrinsically deformable conductors. They concomitantly offer the high electrical conductivity of metals with the ability of liquids to flow and reconfigure. The specific chemical and physical properties of Ga-based LMs differ fundamentally from those of solid conductors and need to be considered to successfully process and implement them into stretchable electronic devices. In this Account, we report on how the key physical and chemical properties of Ga-based LMs can be leveraged to enable repeatable manufacturing and precise patterning of stretchable LM conductors. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the LM, its receiving substrate chemistry and topography, and the environmental conditions is necessary to meet the reproducibility and reliability standards for large scale deployment in next-generation wearable systems. In oxidative environments, a solid oxide skin forms at the surface of the LM and provides enough stiffness to counterbalance surface tension, and prevent the LM from beading up to a spherical shape. We review techniques that advantageously harness the oxide skin to form metastable structures such as spraying, 3D printing, or channel injection. Next, we explore how controlling the environmental condition prevents the formation or removes the oxide skin, thereby allowing for selective wetting of Ga lyophilic surfaces. Representative examples include selective plating and physical vapor deposition. The wettability of LMs can be further tuned by engineering the surface chemistry and topology of the receiving substrate to form superlyophobic or superlyophilic surfaces. In particular, our group developed Ga-superlyophilic substrates by engineering the surface of silicone rubber with microstructures and a gold coating layer. Thermal evaporation of Ga on such engineered substrates allows for the formation of smooth LM films with micrometric thickness control and design freedom. The versatility of the available deposition techniques facilitates the implementation of LM conductors in a wide variety of wearable devices.

Their development has undergone a great push due to their use in recent years; however, they are not yet widely used in clinical practice. CRE implementation in textiles will lead to a low cost, flexible, comfortable, and robust electrode capable of detecting high spatial resolution ECG signals. A textile CRE set has been designed and developed using screen-printing technology. This is a mature technology in the textile industry and, therefore, does not require heavy investments. Inks employed as conductive elements have been silver and a conducting polymer (poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate; PEDOT:PSS). Conducting polymers have biocompatibility advantages, they can be used with flexible substrates, and they are available for several printing technologies. CREs implemented with both inks have been compared by analyzing their electric features and their performance in detecting ECG signals. The results reveal that silver CREs present a higher average thickness and slightly lower skin-electrode impedance than PEDOT:PSS CREs. As for ECG recordings with subjects at rest, both CREs allowed the uptake of bipolar concentric ECG signals (BC-ECG) with signal-to-noise ratios similar to that of conventional ECG recordings. Regarding the saturation and alterations of ECGs captured with textile CREs caused by intentional subject movements, silver CREs presented a more stable response (fewer saturations and alterations) than those of PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, BC-ECG signals provided higher spatial resolution compared to conventional ECG. This improved spatial resolution was manifested in the identification of P1 and P2 waves of atrial activity in most of the BC-ECG signals.

Typically, consolidation has been measured hours or days after the completion of training [2], but the same concept may apply to periods of rest that occur interspersed in a series of practice bouts within the same session. Here, we took an unprecedented close look at the within-seconds time course of early human procedural learning over alternating short periods of practice and rest that constitute a typical online training session. We found that performance did not markedly change over short periods of practice. On the other hand, performance improvements in between practice periods, when subjects were at rest, were significant and accounted for early procedural learning. These offline improvements were more prominent in early training trials when the learning curve was steep and no performance decrements during preceding practice periods were present. At the neural level, simultaneous magnetoencephalographic recordings showed an anatomically defined signature of this phenomenon. Beta-band brain oscillatory activity in a predominantly contralateral frontoparietal network predicted rest-period performance improvements.

The results indicated that the (R)-PEDTM/GCE sensor showed a higher peak current response toward the levo or (S) forms of the tested enantiomers, while the opposite phenomenon occurred for (S)-PEDTM/GCE. The mechanism of the stereospecific interaction between these enantiomers and the chiral polymers was determined. Therefore, a model of the chiral recognition by the chiral conducting polymer electrodes and an electrochemical method was proposed. The chirality of the enantiomers was confirmed by two parameters: the chirality of the electrode and the peak current response. These findings pave the way for the application of chiral PEDOT as electrode modification material in the electrochemical chiral recognition field.""], 'Chiral PEDOT-Based Enantioselective Electrode Modification Material for Chiral Electrochemical Sensing: Mechanism and Model of Chiral Recognition.')","(['Peripheral intraneural stimulation can provide tactile information to amputees.

Biomimetic frequency modulation was perceived as more natural, while amplitude modulation enabled better performance in tasks requiring fine identification of the applied force. Notably, the optimal combination of naturalness and sensitivity of the tactile feedback can be achieved with ""hybrid"" encoding strategies based on simultaneous biomimetic frequency and amplitude neuromodulation.

Findings remain equivocal, possibly owing to the limited ecological validity of computer simulations. Relevant psychological traits, such as impulsivity, which increase the risk of problem gambling, are often not examined. Here, we used immersive virtual reality (VR) to investigate near-miss-induced changes in physiological arousal and VR gambling behaviour. Sixty adult participants with no history of problem gambling were immersed in a VR casino-bar where they engaged with a self-selected slot machine. Real-time heart rate (HR) data were acquired during immersion. Within-subjects analyses were conducted on HR and post-reinforcement pauses (PRPs; i.e., time taken to initiate next-spin) across wins, losses and near-misses. Significant HR acceleration occurred for both near-misses and losses compared to wins, indexing an initial orientation response. Both types of losses were associated with faster next-spin responses. Near-misses did not apparently have unique HR or PRP profiles from losses, although this may reflect our loss control condition, which in itself may have been a subtler near-miss outcome. Impulsivity measured by the SUPPS-P was not associated with near-miss responses. Losses may encourage gambling as participants experience more immediate HR acceleration (indexing arousal unique to losing) and initiate faster responses.

Here, we investigate whether human subjects can learn to integrate two arbitrary, but co-occurring, visual and vestibular cues of self-motion. Participants made size comparisons between two successive whole-body rotations using only visual, only vestibular, and both modalities together. The vestibular stimulus provided a yaw self-rotation cue, the visual a roll (Experiment 1) or pitch (Experiment 2) rotation cue. Experimentally measured thresholds in the bimodal condition were compared with theoretical predictions derived from the single-cue thresholds. Our results show that human subjects combine and optimally integrate vestibular and visual information, each signaling self-motion around a different rotation axis (yaw vs. roll and yaw vs. pitch). This finding suggests that the experience of two temporally co-occurring but spatially unrelated self-motion cues leads to inferring a common cause for these two initially unrelated sources of information about self-motion.

For many applications, polarization-insensitive metasurfaces are highly desirable, and appear to limit the choice of their constituent elements to isotropic nanostructures. This greatly restricts the number of geometric parameters available in design. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-insensitive metalens using otherwise anisotropic nanofins which offer additional control over the dispersion and phase of the output light. As a result, we can render a metalens achromatic and polarization-insensitive across nearly the entire visible spectrum from wavelength λ\u2009=\u2009460\u2009nm to 700\u2009nm, while maintaining diffraction-limited performance. The metalens is comprised of just a single layer of TiO2 nanofins and has a numerical aperture of 0.2 with a diameter of 26.4\u2009µm.

However, p-BCI technology could suffer from some practical issues when used outside the laboratories. In particular, one of the most important limitations is the necessity to recalibrate the p-BCI system each time before its use, to avoid a significant reduction of its reliability in the detection of the considered mental states. The objective of the proposed study was to provide an example of p-BCIs used to evaluate the users' mental workload in a real operational environment. For this purpose, through the facilities provided by the École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile of Toulouse (France), the cerebral activity of 12 professional air traffic control officers (ATCOs) has been recorded while performing high realistic air traffic management scenarios. By the analysis of the ATCOs' brain activity (electroencephalographic signal-EEG) and the subjective workload perception (instantaneous self-assessment) provided by both the examined ATCOs and external air traffic control experts, it has been possible to estimate and evaluate the variation of the mental workload under which the controllers were operating. The results showed (i) a high significant correlation between the neurophysiological and the subjective workload assessment, and (ii) a high reliability over time (up to a month) of the proposed algorithm that was also able to maintain high discrimination accuracies by using a low number of EEG electrodes (~3 EEG channels).

This article describes a novel peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for detecting activity of cell-secreted protease MMP9. In this sensing strategy, a peptide specific to MMP9 was modified with a redox label (methylene blue (MB)) and immobilized on microfabricated 300 μm diameter Au electrodes. Challenging the electrodes with known concentrations of MMP9 resulted in the cleavage of the MB containing peptide fragment and caused a decrease in electrical signal measured by square wave voltammetry (SWV). The limit of detection for MMP9 was determined to be 60 pM with a linear range extending to 50 nM. In preparation to detect cell-secreted MMP9, glass surfaces with Au electrode arrays were further micropatterned with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gel to define annular cell adhesive regions next to electrodes and render the remainder of the surface nonfouling. The surfaces were further modified with CD14 antibody to promote attachment of monocytes. The peptide-modified electrode arrays were integrated into PDMS microfluidic devices and incubated with U-937 cells, transformed monocytes known to produce MMPs.

The solar cells are characterized by a large open circuit voltage of up to 1.03 V, and an efficiency of 8.2% has been achieved for a 5.3 μm thick TiO2 film using an epoxy resin-based sealed cell configuration with a minimal separation between electrodes. Transient short-circuit photocurrent measurements up to an intensity of 3 Suns show a significant decay in photocurrent after an initial peak current upon switching on the light for larger distance, resulting in a lower steady state photocurrent. For the smaller distance cells, the steady state photocurrent is linear with light intensity up to 2 Suns. Charge extraction measurements under short-circuit conditions show that reducing the distance between electrodes increases the electron collection efficiency and thus, the attainable photocurrent. Recombination losses increase with larger electrode separation distance and higher light intensity due to mass transport limitation of the redox mediator. Electrochemical impedance measurements confirm the effect of electrode distance on the redox couple transport, showing an additional loop with increasing distance. For the configuration where the TiO2 film is in very close proximity to the PEDOT-covered counter electrode, inductive behavior is observed at low frequencies.

However, the interactions in such pathways remain controversial. Using a stop-signal response inhibition task and functional imaging with analysis of effective connectivity, we show that the lateral prefrontal cortex influences the strength of communication between regions in the frontostriatal motor system. We compared 20 generative models that represented alternative interactions between the inferior frontal gyrus, presupplementary motor area (preSMA), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and primary motor cortex during response inhibition. Bayesian model selection revealed that during successful response inhibition, the inferior frontal gyrus modulates an excitatory influence of the preSMA on the STN, thereby amplifying the downstream polysynaptic inhibition from the STN to the motor cortex. Critically, the strength of the interaction between preSMA and STN, and the degree of modulation by the inferior frontal gyrus, predicted individual differences in participants' stopping performance (stop-signal reaction time). We then used diffusion-weighted imaging with tractography to assess white matter structure in the pathways connecting these three regions. The mean diffusivity in tracts between preSMA and the STN, and between the inferior frontal gyrus and STN, also predicted individual differences in stopping efficiency. Finally, we found that white matter structure in the tract between preSMA and STN correlated with effective connectivity of the same pathway, providing important cross-modal validation of the effective connectivity measures.

We found that placing mice in an enriched environment before an injury enhanced the activity of proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons, leading to a lasting increase in their regenerative potential. This effect was dependent on Creb-binding protein (Cbp)-mediated histone acetylation, which increased the expression of genes associated with the regenerative program. Intraperitoneal delivery of a small-molecule activator of Cbp at clinically relevant times promoted regeneration and sprouting of sensory and motor axons, as well as recovery of sensory and motor functions in both the mouse and rat model of spinal cord injury.

The MCPP-based electrode displayed comprehensively excellent electrochemical properties, such as a low resistance of 0.45 Ω, a high specific capacitance of 485 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 95% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g-1. An MCPP-based symmetric solid-state supercapacitor with Ni foam as the current collector and PVA/KOH gel as the electrolyte exhibited a specific capacitance of 380 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and achieved a maximum energy density of 13.2 Wh kg-1 (0.25 A g-1) with a power density of 0.126 kW kg-1 or an energy density of 4.86 Wh kg-1 at 10 A g-1, corresponding to a high power density of 4.99 kW kg-1. Another kind of MCPP-based solid-state supercapacitor without the Ni foam showed excellent flexibility and a high volumetric capacitance of 50.4 F cm-3 at 0.05 A cm-3. Both the electrodes and the supercapacitors were environmentally stable and could be operated under remarkable deformation or high temperature without damage to their structural integrity or a significant decrease in capacitive performance. Overall, this work provides a strategy for the fabrication of flexible and conductive energy-storage films with ionic liquid-processed cellulose as a medium.'], 'Highly Flexible and Conductive Cellulose-Mediated PEDOT:PSS/MWCNT Composite Films for Supercapacitor Electrodes.')","(['Post-amputation phantom limb pain (PLP) is a widespread phenomenon that can have physical, psychological, and functional impacts on amputees who experience the condition. The varying presentations and mechanisms of PLP make it difficult to effectively provide long-term pain relief. Multiple neuromodulatory approaches to treating PLP have focused on electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system, with varying degrees of success. More recently, research has been done to study the effects of neuroprosthetic approaches on PLP. Neuroprosthetics combine the use of a functional prosthetic with stimulation to the peripheral nerves in the residual limb. Although many of the neuroprosthetic studies focus on improving function, several have shown preliminary evidence for the reduction of severity of PLP. In this review we provide an overview of the current understanding of the neurological mechanisms that initiate and sustain PLP, as well as the neuromodulatory and neuroprosthetic approaches under development for treatment of the condition.
